# MEN Stack CRUD Project

**Project Type:** First practice project  
**Date:** 2026-01-17

## Description
This was my first project using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js).  
The main focus was to implement **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  

> Note: I know about using `.env` and `.gitignore`, but for this first project, I focused only on CRUD functionality.

## Features
- Basic CRUD operations
- Backend built with Node.js and Express
- MongoDB used as database
- Tested API endpoints with **Thunder Client**

## Setup Instructions
